OCEAN 215 Final Project  
Autumn 2024  

With this project I aimed to discover a location on our Earth that would be the best place to implement and study the effects of introducing a carbon dioxide converting reaction to our oceans. By looking at and creating a map of global sea surface concentrations of carbon dioxide I was able to locate a region of very high CO2 concentration, and by creating a map of global vertical current velocities I was able to see that that same region exhibited higher upwelling rates as well. Then after looking at the region where those two places overlapped, I discovered that the Galapagos Islands are all within that region, making it a perfect location to study the implementation of a carbon dioxide converting reaction.
